      </li>
      <li>
        1 glove garlic, minced
      </li>
      <li>
         2 tsp dried basil
      </li>
      <li>
        2 tsp dried oregano
      </li>
      <li>
        1 tsp salt
      </li>
      <li>
         1 tsp black pepper
      </li>
      <li>

      </li>
      <li>
        1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3> Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the
        hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and
        discard grease. Add spaghetti sauce, tomatoes, onion, garlic, basil,
        oregano, salt, and pepper. Cook over low heat until sauce is hot,
        about 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a
        rolling boil. Cook mafalda noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to
        the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add cooked and drained noodles to the sauce and stir until completely
        coated. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat
        the oven's broiler.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place skillet under the hot broil and cook until cheese is golden and
        bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve and Enjoy!
